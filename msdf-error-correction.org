      (RG,GB,RB)

       ignoring cases where that point is eactly at a sample (or

******** either
********* median interpolated at that point has different sign from sample medians
********* or sample being tested isn't protected and is not between sample medians
******** and interpolated median is not a plausible distance from sample medians
         (a distance field sampled every N units can at most change by
         N between adjacent samples. So for a point between two
         samples,if it is T units from first sample, the interpolated
         distance at that point must be within T of first sample and
         N-T from 2nd)

         (not exact, allow within N% of exact distance)
******* for distance checker w/ contour combiner:
******** run base checker, and if it got to 3rd test and distance was plausible:
********* calculate exact distance to shape at that point
********* calculate interpolated distance from msdf
********* calculate interpolated distance if sample were flattened
********* mark sample if new distance is closer to exact distance
*** diagonal
**** same as horiz/vert, except:
     bilinear interpolation, so need to solve quadratic to find point
      (and possibly 2 points

     also check for a local extreme of each channel of the pair being
     tested along the diagonal, and run artifact check routine with
     the interpolated value at that extreme instead of one of
     corresponding sample

     (ex. if samples are at 0 and 1, test point is at 0.5, channel
     maximum is 0.7, check with 0 and 0.7 instead of 0 and 1)
* apply error correction
** for every sample
*** if marked 'error', set all channels to median
